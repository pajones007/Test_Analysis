#Analyze Volume Profiles

#The volume profile allows any trader to evaluate the market context to keep track of the never-ending auction process. 
#That’s what a market is at the end of the day, a constant negotiating process to find equilibrium/agreement (via the accumulation of transactions at a certain level), 
#and the ones that were perceived too cheap or too expensive (no volume found). 
#The art of reading volume profile is all about studying the anatomy of the market auctions.

#How to read these volume profile structures:

#More specifically, we’ll be using Python and statistical and signal processing tools in SciPy’s suite of modules. Data plots are rendered with Plotly.
